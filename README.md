## About
The **"Stock the Stock"** app is designed to aid in investment decision-making by analyzing historical stock/index data. It assesses market peaks, falls, and rises to suggest potential buy, hold, or sell indicators. The app implements a strategy inspired by [Warren Buffett](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Warren_Buffett)'s famous quote.

>### "*Be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful.*" - Warren Buffett
